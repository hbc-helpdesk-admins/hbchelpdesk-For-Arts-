# Contributor Photo Storage Guidelines

This folder is designed to store photos of contributors for credits purposes. Please follow the instructions below to create and organize your batch folder and store your photos correctly.

## Steps for Contributors:

1. **Create a Batch Folder:**
   - Identify your batch year (e.g., 2027, 2028, etc.).
   - Create a folder inside this directory with the name format: `Batch <Year>`  
     Example: If you are from the batch of 2027, create a folder named **`Batch 2027`**.

2. **Add Your Photo:**
   - Open your respective batch folder.
   - Upload your photo inside the folder.
   - Name your photo file using your **full name** to make it identifiable.  
     Example: If your name is Hassan Abdullah, name the file `Hassan_Abdullah.jpg` or `Hassan_Abdullah.png`.

3. **File Format:**
   - Acceptable formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`.
   - Ensure the image size is optimized (less than 2MB) for easy storage and access.

## Example Folder Structure:
Credits/ ├──> Batch 2027/ ├──> yasin.jpg | maliha.png 
         ├──> Batch 2028/ ├──> rofik.jpg | aria.png
## Notes:
- Please ensure you create or upload files only in your respective batch folder.
- If your batch folder is already created, do not create duplicates.
- Contact the project admin for any issues or corrections.

Thank you for your cooperation!
